## Mission 

Duration: `10 days`

Deadline: `13/04/21 14:00 AM`

Deployment Strategy : `Host on a Raspberry Pi private server.`

In this exercise you must create a Streaming site in html / css, javascript and php.

Get inspired by Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other Popcorn Time,  Stremio ... The goal is to display a catalogue of movies. Spot the  similarities between these platforms (navbar, header, search tool,  different categories of videos‚Ä¶) See what is cool and what works.

### Must-have features

- [x] A session system: registration, connection / disconnection.
- [x] Different rights: registrants have the right to comment on the  content. You can add other rights depending on the different types of  users.
- [x] Include a search bar and sort by filters
- [x] Make a secure code
- [x] Deploy the site. PHP is not supported by github, find free alternatives.

### Nice-to-have features

- [x] Management of lost passwords.
- [x] Back office for user and comment management (CRUD).
- [x] Create a page or section that displays the top movies with the movie db API.
- Integrate a newsletter with Mailchimp.

### Miscellaneousinformation

- [x] The videos will not be hosted by you, a simple link to the Youtube trailer will suffice.

## Project Managing

How the team worked ?

The team was pretty well focused on the task which has to be done since the beginning of this challenge. The first meet was about the direction of the project, giving the defined tasks to each other and then we could start working. There was a feeling of trust toa each other and we knew that the work would be done. 

Anyway every day once or two per day we made a call to explain where we were in our tasks and explain a bit our situation if it was needed + we were always available to help each other the rest of the day. No major problem were faced in our challenge we could go further easily go further in the challenge and find things to add to improve the UX and UI. 

We all have the feeling that we progress in a very nice way from the start of this challenge. We could establish what would be nice to be applied in the next challenge and explain a bit to each other what we learned through this challenge. The key word was for sure "knowledge sharing".

## Mock-Ups 

Basically we took example on Netflix to create the layout of our website, here are some mockups we've made for specific pages. For the movie catalogue and other pages we took inspiration (lot of inspiration) on Netflix.
